# How to Create a Shell Script in Linux

## Introduction
A shell script is a file containing a series of commands that the shell can execute. Shell scripts are useful for automating repetitive tasks.

## Steps to Create a Shell Script

### 1. Login and Open Terminal
Login to your Linux machine and open the terminal.

### 2. Navigate to Desired Directory
Navigate to the folder where you want to store the shell script.

### 3. Create the Shell Script File
Create a new file with a `.sh` extension.
```sh
touch script.sh
```

### 4. Make the Script Executable
By default, the script file is not executable. Change its permissions.
```sh
chmod +x script.sh
```

### 5. Add Commands to the Script
Open the script file with a text editor and add your commands. For example, using `nano`:
```sh
nano script.sh
```
Add the following commands:
```sh
echo "This is my first shell script"
touch testfile
ls
echo "End of my shell script"
```

### 6. Save and Run the Script
Save the changes and run the script.
```sh
./script.sh
```

## Comments in Shell Script
Any line starting with `#` is treated as a comment and ignored during execution.
```sh
# This is a comment
echo "Testing comments in shell script"
```

## Variables in Shell Script
Shell scripts support variables. There are two types:
- **System-defined variables**: Generally capitalized.
- **User-defined variables**: Set by the user and exist only during script execution.
```sh
# Accessing an Environment Variable
echo $USER

# Creating and accessing User-defined Variable
variable_name="GeeksforGeeks"
echo $variable_name
```

## Specifying the Shell Interpreter
Specify the shell interpreter at the top of the script using the shebang line.
```sh
#!/bin/bash
```
